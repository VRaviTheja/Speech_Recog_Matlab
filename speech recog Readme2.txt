First you need fundamentals of speech processing. Witch includes speech signal basic sounds and features. DSP techniques like, FFT, Windowing,STFT.

Some basic signal processing tasks like finding energy, spectrum of speech, autocorrelation, zero crossing detection, silence speech removal techniques etc. Then feature extraction from speech signals.

Feature extraction (LPC,MFCC). Then classification process of feature vectros by VQ.

Then statistical modelling like HMM, GMM.
